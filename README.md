# Design Research Office

This is a static website for Design Research Office architechtural firm, deployed at [https://designresearchoffice.co.uk](https://designresearchoffice.co.uk).

It is written with Gatsby (in Typescript), and hosted on a Microsoft IIS server (not through any choice of my own).

## Scripts

`gatsby develop` runs the development server.

`npm run deploy` builds the production app, and pushes it to the FTP as specified in the `.env` file.
